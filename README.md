# My Academic Website Using Quarto

This repository contains the files for my academic website using Quarto.

I started by using [Marvin Schmitt's](https://www.marvinschmitt.com) template, available at <https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/>.

That template was inspired by [Andrew Heiss's website](https://www.andrewheiss.com), and I borrowed heavily from his repository: <https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-quarto>

I also drew inspiration and code from the websites of [Chris Goodman](https://www.cgoodman.com) and [Silvia Canel√≥n](https://silviacanelon.com).

The color palette comes from my *alma mater*, Middlebury College, though applied quite differently.
