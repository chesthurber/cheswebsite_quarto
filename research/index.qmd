I am an international relations scholar whose research examines global conflict, peace, and security. I explore questions such as: when, why, and how do social groups mobilize for political change? how do social structures, state institutions, and transnational forces shape trajectories of conflict? and what consequences do these forms of conflict have for human, national, and global security? I draw upon theoretical approaches from across the fields of political science, sociology, and conflict resolution. A thread that links much of my work is an attention to the relational and organizational underpinnings of conflict. Methodologically, my work utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques; I have developed original cross-national datasets and engaged in months-long field research trips.
