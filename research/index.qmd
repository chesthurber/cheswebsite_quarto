I am an international relations scholar whose research examines conflict, security, and foreign policy. I am particularly interested in the evolution of irregular modes of conflict and its repercussions for the strategic decision-making of both state and non-state actors. I draw upon theoretical approaches from across the fields of political science, sociology, and conflict resolution. Methodologically, my work utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques; I have developed original cross-national datasets and engaged in months-long field research trips. My first book, *Between Mao and Gandhi*, examined how revolutionary movements evaluate armed and unarmed strategies of resistance. My current book project, "Hot War, Cold War, Color War," explores states' foreign policy responses to the global rise in nonviolent uprisings, responses that have often led to armed interventions.
