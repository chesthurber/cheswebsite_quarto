    "text": "What is this course about?\nFrom the Arab Spring to Black Lives Matter, nonviolent resistance movements have proven capable of sparking tremendous political change. In some cases, they have toppled dictatorships and fostered democratic transitions. In others, they have sparked deadly violence. This course will explore the role of protest movements in global politics. We will ask questions, like:\n\nWhat constitutes “nonviolent” resistance?\nIs it effective? When? Why?\nWhy do some nonviolent movements turn violent?\nWhat, if anything, can the international community do to help nonviolent movements succeed?"

    "text": "What will you learn in this course?\nIn this class, you will become familiar with major debates surrounding the practice of nonviolent, or “civil” resistance. You will learn about several important historical cases, as well as the ways in which social “scientists” have tried to analyze those cases to develop a more general understanding of how protest movements work and the impacts they have.\nIn the liberal arts tradition, I am interested not just in the topical knowledge you acquire, but the skills you develop that you will use in your professional careers and as engaged public citizens. We will work a lot on writing in this course. These won’t be long research theses. Instead, you will be crafting short, argumentative papers, like the ones you are likely to write in your future professional lives in business, law, or public policy. You will be doing some research and honing your research skills, but the emphasis will be on building logical arguments, and backing up those arguments with evidence."

New York: Columbia University Press, 2011.\nAdam Roberts and Timothy Garton-Ash, eds. Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.\n\nWhile you do not need to buy any textbooks for this course, students will be asked to sign up for the online service Packback which costs $49. A passcode can be purchased from the NIU bookstore, allowing costs to be covered by scholarships or financial aid, if applicable. If this does not apply to you, you can instead pay online directly through Packback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackback is the one thing you need to buy for this course ($50)\n\n\n\nWhile there are no required texts, the one thing you will have to spend money on in this course in Packback, which we will be using for discussion boards and papers. It costs $49 for the semester. You can pay for it directly online or buy an access code from the bookstore. More details will be provided in a video o posted on Blackboard."

    "section": "What is Packback?!?",
    "text": "What is Packback?!?\nWe will be using an online suite of learning services called “Packback.” We will primarily be using Packback in two ways: 1) As a discussion board with weekly posting requirements, and 2) as a mechanism for writing and submitting your papers. The advantage of Packback is that it provides greater opportunities for engagement and feedback, especially in the context of an online asynchonous class.\nThe disadvantage of Packback is that it will cost you money. I take this drawback seriously and am assigning Packback this year only after getting very positive reviews from students who used it with me in in classes over the past three years.\nBy midnight every Sunday, you will be required to post THREE times on the Packback discussion board. In one post you will pose a question for your classmates. In the other two you will respond to questions your classmates or I have posed.\nWe will also be using Packback as the mechanism for submitting the four papers you will be writing over the semester. This is a new Packback feature, which they are calling “Deep Dives.” Think of it like an advanced version of Grammarly for college writing. You write your paper directly in Packback, or you can copy and paste your paper from another word processor if you prefer. Packback will help you spot grammatical issues, make stylistic suggestions, and assist you with citations. My goal is that by Packback assisting with these elements, 1) you will be able to make grammatical and citation corrections before you submit your paper, thus earning a higher grade; 2) I will be able to focus my feedback on the substance of what you have written. Again, I used this in my international security class last fall and have decided to use it again based on the strong positive feedback of former students."

The first assignment will as for a brief overview of the case, while the second and third will analyze key concepts introduced in the course. The writing assignments are due at 5pm on Friday afternoons as indicated in the course schedule below.\nFinal Video: (15%) During the last week of class, you will create a 5-10 minute video presentation describing the case you studied over the semester and the lessons you drew from it. Alternative modes of presentation are welcome with approval of instructor.\nVideo Comments: (5%) During the exam week, you will write comments on the videos of 4-6 classmates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Routine\n\n\n\nMost weeks, your course routine will involve:\n\nReading assigned texts\nWatching lecture videos\nCompleting a 5-question multiple choice quiz\nSubmitting 3 posts on Packback discussion boards\n\nIn other weeks, you will have a writing assignment.\nIn all weeks, work is due SUNDAY by MIDNIGHT."

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nCommited to your success: Beyond all else, I am committed to all of your success in this class. I encourage everyone in the class to reach out to me if there is anything I can do in terms of the delivery of the course that would help you be more successful. I might not always be able to make it happen, but I will never discourage you from asking. For example, our use of YouTube’s transcript feature for lecture videos, and the Sunday (as opposed to Friday) deadline, are all the result of prior year student requests.\nNames and Pronouns: I ask that my undergraduate students refer to me as either Dr. or Professor Thurber. I’m just old-school that way. I usually use the he/him/this pronouns to refer to myself, but am equally comfortable being referred to with they/them/their. Please let me know how you prefer to be addressed, both in name and pronoun, especially if it differs from what is in the college directory. I will make every effort to address you in the way you wish to be addressed. Please try and do the same for your fellow classmates, as well as for other faculty in the department.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Non-Discrimination Statement: If you need an accommodation for this class, please contact the Disability Resource Center as soon as possible. The DRC coordinates accommodations for students with disabilities. It is located on the 4th floor of the Health Services Building, and can be reached at 815-753-1303 or drc@niu.edu. Also, please contact me privately as soon as possible so we can discuss your accommodations. Please note that you will not be required to disclose your disability, only your accommodations. The sooner you let me know your needs, the sooner I can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.\nMental Health and Well-being: I understand that college students may experience a range of academic, social, and personal stressors, which can be overwhelming. You are not alone. Well-being at NIU offers resources, programs, and services. If you or someone you know need assistance with comprehensive or crisis mental health support, Counseling and Consultation Services (CCS) at 815-753-1206 is ready to help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 988.\n\nAcademic Integrity: Good academic work must be based on honesty. The attempt of any student to present as his or her own work that which he or she has not produced is regarded by the faculty and administration as a serious offense. Students are considered to have cheated if they copy the work of another during an examination or turn in a paper or an assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else. Students are guilty of plagiarism, intentional or not, if they copy material from books, magazines, or other sources without identifying and acknowledging those sources or if they paraphrase ideas from such sources without acknowledging them. Students guilty of, or assisting others in, either cheating or plagiarism on an assignment, quiz, or examination may receive a grade of F for the course involved and may be suspended or dismissed from the university.\nThis is an issue I take seriously. Unfortuntely it has increasingly become an issue in my courses. The creation of one’s own original work is the core of what a university education is all about. Falsely claiming credit for words or ideas that are not your own undermines that core. I will use software that tracks plagiarism as well as for similarities with classmates’ or even your own prior work. When work looks suspicious, I will often use additional measures to identify the original sources of plagiarized text. In this course, academic dishonest will always result in an F on the assignment and a formal misconduct report filed with the university. The recommendation I make in that report (e.g. failure from the course, suspension, expulsion from the university) will depend on the circumstance.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is not prohibited in this course. However, I highly discourage their use. No doubt, AI will be an important tool for you in the future, and learning it well will be an important skill to acquire. I am not in a position yet to be able to help teach you how best to use AI as a tool because I’m still figuring it out for myself. As of now, I see two major problems: a) AI tools are still very flawed, and you have not yet developed the expertise to decipher when they are producing fraudulent content; and b) I fear that relying on them at this stage of your studies will impede your development of key research and writing skills that you will need to be successful. So with this in mind, I am not banning it per se – there’s no penalty for using AI – but you are responsible for the substance of what you submit. If ChatGPT generates incorrect facts, false references, or even plagiarizes, and you use that content in your assignment, you will be penalized just as you would for such infractions without the assistance of AI."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Shia militia has emerged as one of the most powerful and important actors in the Middle East security environment. Despite this trend, they remain poorly understood by scholars and policymakers alike. This article seeks to expand our understanding of the militia as a type of non-state armed group through an examination of Shia militia movements in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. More than simply warlords, paramilitaries, or foreign proxies, Shia militias in Iraq enjoyed substantial popular legitimacy, pursued a broad social and political agenda, and participated actively in the formal institutions of the state. Understanding the triangular relationship between the militia, the state, and the population is essential in explaining the rise and fall of the Shia militias during the US occupation as well as in developing strategies to deal with their most recent resurgence\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{thurber2014,\n  author = {Ches Thurber},\n  title = {Militias as Sociopolitical Movements: {Lessons} from {Iraq’s}\n    Armed {Shia} Groups},\n  journal = {Small Wars and Insurgencies},\n  volume = {25},\n  number = {5-6},\n  pages = {900 - 923},\n  date = {2014},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1080/09592318.2014.945633},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nWhile ethnic cleavages have featured prominently in our understanding of civil wars, attention to ethnic and social structures has been surprisingly absent from the recent wave of research on civil resistance. Yet these structures likely have an important impact on when and where we see nonviolent campaigns occur. This article argues that the strategic logic of civil resistance presents high barriers to entry for politically excluded ethnic minorities. Constraints on these groups’ ability to activate mechanisms central to an exclusively nonviolent strategy either prevent them from getting a civil resistance campaign off the ground or deter them from ever attempting to do so. Using original data on the ethnic composition of nonviolent and violent campaigns, I show that nonviolent campaigns are less likely than violent ones to include participants from politically disadvantaged ethnic groups and also less likely to feature ethnic political claims. Furthermore, I find that political exclusion and small group size reduce the likelihood that members of an ethnic group will initiate a campaign of civil resistance.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{thurber2018,\n  author = {Ches Thurber},\n  title = {Ethnic Barriers to Civil Resistance},\n  journal = {Journal of Global Security Studies},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {255 - 270},\n  date = {2018},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogy018},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe ethnic composition of state security forces is believed to have important effects on the dynamics of conflict processes, but data limitations have impeded our ability to test such hypotheses cross-nationally until now. To address this problem, the Security Force Ethnicity dataset provides time-series, group-level measures of the ethnic composition of military forces in the Middle East between 1946 and 2013. We draw on an extensive review of case studies and histories to produce unique ordinal codings for participation rates in the officer corps and in the rank and file. We demonstrate the utility of the data through empirical applications, examining the relationship between military ethnic composition and the incidence of coups and repression. Our findings illustrate the theoretical and empirical importance of disaggregating ethnic representation in the military from inclusion in other institutions of the state.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{johnson2020,\n  author = {Paul Lorenzo Johnson and Ches Thurber},\n  title = {The Security-Force Ethnicity {(SFE)} Project: Introducing a\n    New Dataset},\n  journal = {Conflict Management and Peace Science},\n  volume = {37},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {106 - 129},\n  date = {2020},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1177/0738894217709012},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study proposes an organizational mechanism that links ideology to the use of terrorism in mass dissident campaigns. Ideology affects the level of competition among factions within mass dissident campaigns by shaping whether actors see their interactions as a positive- or zero-sum game. We identify ideological diversity within a campaign and the degree to which ideologies embrace the principle of pluralism as key factors affecting the intensity of factional competition and, consequently, the occurrence of terrorism. We introduce new data on the ideologies of campaigns from the Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes 2.0 dataset and use causal mediation analysis to test our proposed mechanism. We find that greater ideological diversity within a campaign increases the likelihood of terrorism by increasing factional competition. We also find that the presence of a pluralist ideology is associated with a lower likelihood of terrorism by the lowering of factional competition. By shedding light on the mechanisms that link ideology to terrorism, this study helps advance our understanding of why dissident groups might decide to use terrorism tactics within the context of a campaign of mass resistance.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{belgioioso2024,\n  author = {Margherita Belgioioso and Ches Thurber},\n  title = {From Doctrine to Detonation: Ideology, Competition, and\n    Terrorism in Campaigns of Mass Resistance},\n  journal = {Journal of Peace Research},\n  volume = {61},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {333 - 350},\n  date = {2024},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433221135338},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nThis article examines the impact of social ties on a challenger’s ability to initiate a civil resistance campaign. Recent waves of nonviolent uprisings, from the color revolutions of Eastern Europe to the Arab Spring, have sparked renewed scholarly interest in civil resistance as a strategy in conflict. However, most research has focused on the effectiveness and outcomes of civil resistance, with less attention paid to when, why, and how challengers to regime power come to embrace a strategy of nonviolent action in the first place. Drawing upon a longitudinal analysis of challenger organizations and coalitions in Nepal, this article illustrates how social ties inform challengers’ assessments of the viability of civil resistance and consequently shape their strategic behavior. The findings complicate state-centric approaches to contentious politics by showing how diverse actors within the same state face different sets of political opportunities and constraints. They also highlight the indeterminate effects of ideology, as variation in challengers’ social ties drive Gandhians to take up arms and Maoists to lay them down.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{thurber2019,\n  author = {Ches Thurber},\n  title = {Social Ties and the Strategy of Civil Resistance},\n  journal = {International Studies Quarterly},\n  volume = {63},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {974 - 986},\n  date = {2019},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqz049},\n  langid = {en}\n}"

How do dissidents come to embrace a nonviolent strategy in the first place? Why do others rule it out in favor of taking up arms? Despite a new wave of attention to the effectiveness and global impact of nonviolent movements, our understanding of their origins and trajectories remains limited. Drawing on cases from Nepal, Syria, India and South Africa, as well as global cross-national data, this book details the processes through which challenger organizations come to embrace or reject civil resistance as a means of capturing state power. It develops a relational theory, showing how the social ties that underpin challenger organizations shape their ability and willingness to attempt regime change using nonviolent means alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@book{thurber2021,\n  author = {Ches Thurber},\n  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},\n  title = {Between {Mao} and {Gandhi:} The {Social} {Roots} of {Civil}\n    {Resistance}},\n  date = {2021},\n  url = {https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/between-mao-and-gandhi-social-roots-civil-resistance?format=PB},\n  langid = {en}\n}"
