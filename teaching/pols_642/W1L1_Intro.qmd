## Diving right in...

-   in groups, check out [this APSR article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/do-donors-punish-extremist-primary-nominees-evidence-from-congress-and-american-state-legislatures/50ACE93E42F2CE12BC079CAD78F2D240); read only the abstract and intro

-   what's the research question? what's the hypothesis?

-   what are the IV and DV? how are they measured?

-   what are the research methods?

-   what challenges is the author trying to overcome by using these methods?

## Challenges to inference

Inference in the process of trying to use facts we know learn facts we don't know

Bailey describes two fundamental challenges to inference:

-   the problem of **randomness**: how do we know if patterns in our sample are true in the broader population

-   the problem of **causality**: when can we be confident that a relationship between two variables is due to one causing the other?

This course focuses on both, maybe more on the former?

## Some important points

-   The challenges of randomness and causality are not unique to quantitative research

-   They are not the only things we should be thinking about in assessing "good" research

-   What makes for "good" research?

## My View on "Good Research"


"The best advice I received in the discipline was that it is better to take B+ swings at A+ questions than A+ swings at B+ questions."

 - Erica Chenoweth, Harvard Kennedy School

## My View on Quantitative Methods

-   it can help spot trends and puzzles

-   it can put a specific case in context

-   it can assess the generalizability of a pattern

-   it can adjudicate between competing explanations

-   it opens up specific toolkits (surveys, experiments)

-   it's a tool in service of a bigger goal

## Dr. Kuehl's View

-   "our focus will be on causal inference"

-   "underlying everything we are doing is the concept of causality"

## My View on R  {background-image="https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*rQeAncJKbDp6awdgBSF-Yg.jpeg" background-color="white"}

-   it's a tool to help make working with data easier (ha!)

-   the replicability advantage

-   the ability to manipulate data

-   graphical representation

-   FREE!

## What We Will Learn in this Course

- Review of basic stats and regression (641)
- Deeper dive into regression with focus on assumptions, violations, remedies
- Introduction to thinking about Causal Inference
- Additional methods, if time permits
